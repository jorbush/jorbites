This update brings several key improvements to continue polishing the experience within the app. Here’s what’s new:

## 🔍 Search Improvements
– Added the translation key for **"search"**.
– Re-enabled **rate limiting** with per-user limits to ensure search functions better and without blocks.

## 👨‍🍳 More Accurate Trending Chefs
– Trending Chefs are now calculated based on activity from the **last month**, instead of the last year, highlighting current creators.

## ⚙️ Performance and UX Improvements
– Fixed an unnecessary refresh when opening the **settings modal**.

## 📅 Recurring Events
– Support for **monthly events**, starting with the new: **"29 of Gnocchis"**.
– Updated the Gnocchi event with its new end time and details.
