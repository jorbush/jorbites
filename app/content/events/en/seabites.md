Let's dive into an ocean of culinary traditions and explore the most delicious treasures from the sea!

## 🌊 The Challenge

Create and share your favorite seafood recipe from any corner of the world! From Spanish paella to Louisiana gumbo, Japanese ramen to Greek kakavia—every coastal cuisine has its own way of celebrating the bounty of the sea. Show us your take on these classics or surprise us with your own oceanic innovation!
