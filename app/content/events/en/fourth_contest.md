## 🗺️ Story

### 🥑 Paltín in Japan: A Culinary Mission

This weekend, our beloved Paltín has embarked on a new journey. This time, with an even bigger mission: representing Jorbites in Japan. ✈️🇯🇵

Since deciding to stay at our offices, Paltín has been restless. His wandering spirit and passion for gastronomy drove him to seek new horizons. He needed more. He needed to discover flavors, textures, and culinary secrets he had never tasted before.

So, with his small luggage (and a slight fear of planes, because avocados don't usually fly), he set off for the land of the rising sun. His goal was clear: to meet with the bigwigs of Japanese cuisine and discuss the possibility of the next Jorbites Contest being dedicated to Japanese cooking. 🍣🍜

After days of intense meetings, long walks through alleyways full of izakayas, and nights reflecting under Kyoto lanterns, Paltín accomplished his mission.

Although initially received with skepticism ("A Latin American avocado wants to talk about our cuisine?"), his respect, enthusiasm, and deep love for food won over the great Japanese masters. He spoke to them about ramen, sushi, curry... and the potential of the Jorbites community.

Finally, they said:

> "Paltín-san... we are impressed. So be it."

🎌 The next Jorbites Contest would be about Japanese food! 🎌

### 🐉 Honor, dragons and lost uramakis

Just as the deal was being sealed at a banquet in Kyoto, two blue dragons descended from Mount Fuji and kidnapped one of the great masters.

Amidst the chaos, only one reacted: Paltín.

With ceremonial kimono and ancestral katana (decorative, but sharp), he silently departed for the mountain.

🏯 He confronted the dragons on a hanging bridge. It was fire against blade, claw against avocado.

And he won. Not with force, but with strategy, balance... and a touch of soy sauce.

He rescued the master and, as a peace offering, prepared blue dragon uramakis with rice tempered by real fire. A legendary recipe...

> "They were so good... that I forgot to take a picture."
> —Paltín, with a tear that tasted of wasabi.

A recipe lost forever. But its spirit will live on in every roll you prepare.

### 🐉 Will Paltín make it to the contest?

On the day of the event, a question echoed through the kitchens:

> Where is Paltín?

The answer came from the sky. One of the dragons, moved by the avocado's honor, adopted him as a rider and named him *Friend of the Celestial Fire*.

Paltín soared through the skies mounted on his new ally. And although nobody knew if he would arrive on time...

> Paltín is never late. He arrives when the flavor requires it.
