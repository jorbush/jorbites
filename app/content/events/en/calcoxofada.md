# 🔥 The Calçoxofada: Feast of the Embers 🧅

Get ready to get your hands dirty and enjoy the most authentic event at Jorbites!

From February 1st to 28th, we celebrate the union of the two great passions of the winter garden: **Calçots** and **Artichokes** (Carxofes). Because choosing is boring, we have created the ultimate party to pay homage to fire, earth, and Romesco sauce.

- **Grilled Calçots**: The sacred ritual (bib essential!)
- **Roasted Artichokes**: Roasted on the embers, tender and smoky
- **Calçot Tempura**: The crunchy and modern touch
- **Artichokes with Clams**: A classic surf and turf

### 🌟 Why "The Calçoxofada" is special:

It is the exact moment when the cold brings out the best of the garden:
- **Seasonal Flavor**: The February cold makes the calçots sweeter.
- **Shared Ritual**: It's not just eating, it's the experience of peeling the calçot and dipping it in the sauce.
- **Health and Pleasure**: Artichokes cleanse what the party makes us sin.
- **Versatility**: Grilled, baked, or confit; these ingredients handle it all.

### 🎯 Accept the challenge:

Light the fire! We want to see tables full of tiles with calçots and trays of steaming artichokes. Whether in a farmhouse or in the oven of your apartment, February is the month of the **Calçoxofada**! 🔥✨
