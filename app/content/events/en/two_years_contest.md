# 🥂 Two Years of Jorbites 🥂

Two years ago, Jorbites was born with a simple idea: share recipes, learn together, and enjoy cooking. What started as a small spark has become a vibrant, creative, and delicious community.

And to celebrate properly... we're launching a special anniversary contest!

## 🧁 Theme

Montaditos, tapas, festive bites, mini-dishes with soul. We want to see the best in small format: from classic bread-and-topping to bold gourmet reinventions.

Think celebrations, elegant finger food, that recipe that makes you say: "okay, just one more."

## 📆 Date

Saturday, June 28, 2025 – Vermouth time

## 🏆 Prize
- A Jorbites surprise gift (yes, limited edition)
- A new exclusive medal for the winner

## 📌 Rules
- ✅ Recipe must be in draft mode (cloud icon top right) before the event
- ✅ It will be published during the contest
- ❌ Publishing before or after will subtract 2 points
- 👫 Can you participate as a pair? Yes, using the co-authoring feature
- 🎭 Bonus? Yes: Coming dressed in celebration attire (birthday outfit, drink in hand, or something festive) can give you +1 or +2 points depending on how elaborate it is

Thank you for being part of this adventure. Two years of cooking, laughter, and community. Now... let's celebrate bite by bite!


### 🥂 Two Years of Jorbites – CONTEST FINISHED! 🥂

Last night we cooked history. Between buns, puff pastries, combed salmon and tortillas with flow, we celebrated two years of the platform as we know best: **bite by bite**.

🥇 **Absolute winner: Puff pastry spirals**
By **Albert**
A pizza that disguised itself as sushi. Easy, crispy and dangerous: you eat one and you can't stop.
📸 *"Eat them quickly because cold they're worth nothing"*. Oven wisdom.

🥈 **Rest of the contest wonders:**

🍔 **Truffled gourmet mini burgers**
By **Raúl** & **Alicia**
More than montaditos, they're small masterpieces. Melted cheese, quail eggs and flavor architecture.
🔥 *"The golden seal"*. And the craving too.

🐟 **Combed salmon tartare**
By **Jordi**
An elegant and sentimental montadito. Sharp tartar sauce, toast with blueberries and emotion on the surface.
💅 Just right between fancy and enjoyable.

🟠 **Pickled mussel sauce**
By **Alicia**

🥔 **Tortilla pincho**
By **María** & **Jack**
Classic tortilla with zucchini and well-made bread with tomato. The combo that never fails.
🍳 *"Toasted bread + tortilla + love = patriotic pincho".*

🍯 **Mallorcan pincho**
By **Jack** & **María**

💘 One step, a thousand reasons to repeat.
