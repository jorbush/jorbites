# 🥂 Two Years of Jorbites 🥂

Two years ago, Jorbites was born with a simple idea: share recipes, learn together, and enjoy cooking. What started as a small spark has become a vibrant, creative, and delicious community.

And to celebrate properly... we're launching a special anniversary contest!

## 🧁 Theme

Montaditos, tapas, festive bites, mini-dishes with soul. We want to see the best in small format: from classic bread-and-topping to bold gourmet reinventions.

Think celebrations, elegant finger food, that recipe that makes you say: "okay, just one more."

## 📆 Date

Saturday, June 28, 2025 – Vermouth time

## 🏆 Prize
- A Jorbites surprise gift (yes, limited edition)
- A new exclusive medal for the winner

## 📌 Rules
- ✅ Recipe must be in draft mode (cloud icon top right) before the event
- ✅ It will be published during the contest
- ❌ Publishing before or after will subtract 2 points
- 👫 Can you participate as a pair? Yes, using the co-authoring feature
- 🎭 Bonus? Yes: Coming dressed in celebration attire (birthday outfit, drink in hand, or something festive) can give you +1 or +2 points depending on how elaborate it is

Thank you for being part of this adventure. Two years of cooking, laughter, and community. Now... let's celebrate bite by bite!
