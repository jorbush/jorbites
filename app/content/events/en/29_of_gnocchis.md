# 🥟 29 of Gnocchis 🥟

Every 29th of the month, we celebrate the Italian tradition of **Gnocchi Day**! This beloved custom originated in South American countries with Italian immigrant communities, particularly in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.

## 🇮🇹 The Tradition

The tradition dates back to when Italian families would prepare gnocchi on the 29th because it was an affordable meal to make at the end of the month, just before payday. Today, it has become a cherished food tradition celebrated across the world!

Legend has it that placing money under your plate while eating gnocchi on the 29th brings good luck and prosperity for the coming month.

## 🍝 The Challenge

Share your best gnocchi recipe with the Jorbites community! Whether it's classic potato gnocchi with tomato sauce, gnocchi alla romana, gnocchi with pesto, or your own creative twist—we want to see it all!

## 📋 How to Participate

- Create and publish your gnocchi recipe on Jorbites on the 29th of any month
- Any style of gnocchi is welcome: potato, semolina, ricotta, or even innovative flavors
- Share the story behind your recipe or your connection to this tradition

## 🏆 Reward
