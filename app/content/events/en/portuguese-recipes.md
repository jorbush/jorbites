### 🇵🇹✨ New event in Jorbites: Recipes from Portugal! ✨🇵🇹

From April 30 to May 11, we transport us to Portuguese lands with all the flavor and passion it deserves!
And this time we are not traveling alone... Paltin is going on a business trip to Portugal! 🥑✈️

To support him in his international mission, we want to fill Jorbites with Portuguese recipes: cod, pastéis de nata, francesinhas... anything goes as long as it smells of Portugal! 🥘🍮

Post your Portugal-inspired recipe during the event and get the special medal Recipes from Portugal 🏅, exclusive this week.

Let's make Paltín feel at home, wherever he goes!
Mãos à obra, jorbiteros!!! (Hands on!)
