### 🇵🇹✨ New event in Jorbites: Recipes from Portugal! ✨🇵🇹

During this event, we transport us to Portuguese lands with all the flavor and passion it deserves!
And this time we are not traveling alone... Paltin is going on a business trip to Portugal! 🥑✈️

To support him in his international mission, we want to fill Jorbites with Portuguese recipes: cod, pastéis de nata, francesinhas... anything goes as long as it smells of Portugal! 🥘🍮

Post your Portugal-inspired recipe during the event and get the special medal Recipes from Portugal 🏅, exclusive to this event.

Let's make Paltín feel at home, wherever he goes!
Mãos à obra, jorbiteros!!! (Hands on!)
