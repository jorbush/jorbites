# 🥑 Jorbites Contest 1

The **first Jorbites Contest** marked the beginning of a new chapter: a culinary community was born, hungry to share, learn, and be amazed by each recipe.

No complex rules, no spectacular prizes. Only one thing mattered: **cooking something worth remembering**.

It was an experiment. A first step. But one that made it clear that in Jorbites there's a lot of talent... and a lot to savor.
