### 🐉🌹 Special Sant Jordi 2025 🌹🐉

This April 23rd, tradition and cuisine join hands at Jorbites. Are you brave enough to cook with legend? 👩‍🍳📜✨

If you publish a recipe inspired by Sant Jordi (whether it includes roses, dragons, books or lots of love), you'll receive the official Sant Jordi 2025 medal 🏅🌹 —a unique badge that's only given once a year.

It can be sweet or savory, red like a rose or golden like armor... what matters is that it carries the soul of a story and the heart of a chef.

🔥 One day, one story, one recipe. Celebrate love, culture, and good food with us. Let your kitchen tell stories too! 📖🍴



### 📚🌹 Sant Jordi 2025 at Jorbites has been... a legendary delight! 🌹📚

This year, the love for culture and gastronomy united in our kitchen and left us with recipes as original as they are tasty. Here are three culinary gems that shone brightly this April 23rd:

 🍰 **Sant Jordi Mini Cake**

A classic sponge cake, topped with crema catalana and caramel, and decorated with fruit to form an edible senyera (Catalan flag). And yes, there's even a little dragon on top! 🐉
Silvia, with her level 101, has shown that pastry can also tell stories.

🥪 **Sant Jordi Sandwich**

Creativity served between bread. Marinated chicken, melted cheese and festive ketchup. All this with the phrase that won our hearts: "Without further ado, I want my badge because this is awesome." 😂🔥

A work of artisanal bread with sobrassada and cheddar cheese, forming the fluffiest senyera we've ever seen. Ideal for those who want Sant Jordi... all year round!
