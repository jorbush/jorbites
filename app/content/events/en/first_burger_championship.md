# 🍔 First Jorbites Burger Championship 🍔

This September, get ready for a **brand new burger contest experience** at Jorbites!

## 🍳 A Live Cooking Showdown

This time, the contest will be different from anything we've done before. Inspired by shows like "MasterChef" and games like "Overcooked", the challenge is to **cook your burger live, in front of everyone**.

- You can prepare your sauce or some ingredients at home.
- But the burger patty and the final assembly must be cooked and mounted **on the spot**, in front of all participants!

Whether you join as a team or go solo (for the brave ones!), you'll have to show your skills under pressure and in real time.

## 👀 How It Works

1. **Prepare your sauces or special ingredients at home** (if you want).
2. **Bring everything you need for your burger** (except the cooked patty and final assembly).
3. **Cook and assemble your burger live** during the event, in front of the audience.
4. **Publish your recipe** on Jorbites right after your live cooking session.

## 🏅 Tasting & Secret Grading

After all burgers are ready, **three random participants** will be chosen to taste each burger and give feedback. Each taster will also give a **secret grade** to keep the suspense high!

## 🎉 Why Join?

- Show off your creativity and burger skills
- Experience the thrill of live cooking
- Get instant feedback from fellow foodies
- Have fun and maybe win the title of Jorbites Burger Champion!

**Ready to flip, sizzle, and impress? See you in September!**
