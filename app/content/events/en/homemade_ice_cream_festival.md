# 🍦 Homemade Ice Cream Festival 🍦

Jorbites is turning up the chill factor with the return of our **Homemade Ice Cream Festival**! Whether you're a gelato genius, a sorbet sorcerer, or a soft-serve scientist, this is your moment to scoop, swirl, and surprise us all.

## 🧊 The Challenge

Create your most original, delicious, or even daring homemade ice cream. Don't have an ice cream maker? No problem! All styles and methods are welcome: churned, no-churn, popsicles, granitas, vegan, boozy, or even savory—if it’s cold and creative, it counts!

## 🎨 Festival Rules

- The ice cream must be **homemade** (no store-bought bases!)
- Any flavor, any style—let your imagination run wild
- Post your recipe on Jorbites **during the festival**
- Share the story or inspiration behind your flavor in the post

## 🍧 Community Fun

- **Flavor Roulette:** Feeling brave? Ask the community to suggest a surprise ingredient for you
- **Frozen Parade:** We’ll be showcasing the most creative, beautiful, or unexpected entries on social media

## 🏆 Reward

- Every participant who publishes their recipe on Jorbites following the festival rules will receive the exclusive event badge.

**Ready to freeze the competition? Grab your scoop and let's make this summer even sweeter!**
