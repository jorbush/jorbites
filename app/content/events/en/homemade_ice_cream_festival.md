# 🍦 Homemade Ice Cream Festival 🍦

This July, Jorbites is turning up the chill factor with our first-ever **Homemade Ice Cream Festival**! Whether you're a gelato genius, a sorbet sorcerer, or a soft-serve scientist, this is your moment to scoop, swirl, and surprise us all.

## 🧊 The Challenge

Create your most original, delicious, or downright wild homemade ice cream. No ice cream maker? No problem! All styles and methods are welcome: classic churned, no-churn, popsicles, granitas, vegan, boozy, or even savory ice creams—if it's cold and creative, it counts!

## 🎨 Festival Rules

- Your ice cream must be **homemade** (no store-bought bases!)
- Any flavor, any style—let your imagination run wild
- Publish your recipe on Jorbites between **July 11 and July 27, 2025**
- Tell us the story or inspiration behind your flavor in your post

## 🍧 Community Fun

- **Flavor Roulette:** Want a challenge? Ask the community to suggest a surprise ingredient for you to use!
- **Ice Cream Parade:** We'll feature the most creative, beautiful, or unexpected entries on our social media

## 🏆 Reward

- Every participant who publishes their recipe on Jorbites following the festival rules will receive the exclusive event badge.

**Ready to freeze the competition? Grab your spoons and let's make this the sweetest summer ever!**
