# 🥑 Jorbites Contest 3: The Origin of Paltín 🍽️

This edition was more special than ever. The reason? The official presentation of our new mascot: **Paltín**. An adventurous avocado with a story as deep as it is delicious.

## 📖 History

### 🥑 The story of Paltín: an avocado in search of its destiny

Paltín was born among the vibrant flavors of **Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela**. His early life wasn't easy: hunger and scarcity marked his path. But he dreamed of something more. He dreamed of a world where every bite was art and culinary creativity, a celebration.

With hope and courage, he embarked on an epic journey. He crossed mountains, rivers, borders, and storms, until he finally found refuge in an unexpected place: the **Jorbites** offices.

There, with weathered skin and a soul full of hope, he looked at us and said:

> "I've traveled here looking for the best chefs. I don't want to ever go hungry again. I want to taste recipes that make me cry with emotion. Is this the right place?"

Without hesitation, we answered:
**"Welcome home, Paltín."**

From that moment on, the contest had a new purpose: to prove to Paltín that his journey had been worth it.

## 🎁 Prize

### 🥇 What did participants take home?

- The possibility to **keep Paltín** as a prize (yes, literally a physical plushie with an avocado soul).
- An **exclusive medal** symbolizing flavor, roots, and passion for Latin cuisine.

> ❗ Note: Unlike previous editions, the winner did not receive the "verified" badge.

Additionally, an important decision was made:
> **Paltín officially stayed at the Jorbites offices**, as a mentor and culinary ambassador for future editions.

From there, he began contacting old friends... traveling ingredients that will very soon bring more stories and flavors to the Jorbites world.
