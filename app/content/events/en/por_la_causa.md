# 🇵🇪 Por la Causa: Flavor and Friendship 🍋

¡Habla, Causa! Get ready for the tastiest culinary trip at Jorbites.

From February 7th to March 7th, we travel to Peru without leaving the kitchen. **"Por la Causa"** is our tribute to one of the world's best cuisines and the value of friendship (because in Peru, a "causa" is a close friend). From the Pacific coast to the Andes, we want to fill the platform with acidity, spice, and lots of color.

### 🏆 Win your exclusive badge!

All Jorbiters who post a Peruvian recipe or a fusion inspired by its ingredients (yellow chili (ají amarillo), lime, quinoa...) will receive the exclusive **Por la Causa** badge.

### 🌶️ Recipe ideas to inspire you:

- **Causa Limeña**: The queen of the event. Layers of yellow potato, chili, and filling of your choice.
- **Classic Ceviche**: Fresh fish, tiger's milk (leche de tigre), and just the right amount of heat.
- **Lomo Saltado**: The King of the Wok. Beef, onions, tomatoes, and french fries.
- **Ají de Gallina**: Creamy, comforting, and full of history.
- **Papa a la Huancaína**: The perfect starter with its cheese and yellow chili sauce.
- **Nikkei Tiradito**: The perfect fusion between Japanese technique and Peruvian flavor.
- **Anticuchos**: Street flavor and heart (literally!) on the grill.
- **Suspiro a la Limeña**: To finish with an intense and delicious sweet treat.

### 🌟 Why Peruvian cuisine is unique:

Peru has been chosen multiple times as the world's best culinary destination for good reasons:
- **Cultural Fusion**: It is the result of mixing Inca, Spanish, African, Chinese (Chifa), and Japanese (Nikkei) influences.
- **The DNA of Flavor**: The balance between the acidity of lime and the heat of chili peppers is addictive.
- **Superfoods**: It is the land of quinoa, maca, and thousands of potato varieties.
- **Vibrant Colors**: Cooking Peruvian means painting the plate yellow, red, and green.

### 🎯 Accept the challenge:

Get out the mortar and squeeze the limes! We want to see how you master tiger's milk or how you put a spin on a stuffed causa. Whether it's a traditional dish or a bold fusion, this month we cook... **Por la Causa!** 🇵🇪✨
