## 🏗️ Architecture

Jorbites follows a modern microservices architecture for scalability and performance:

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture/architecture.png)

### Core Platform
- **Main App:** Next.js with TypeScript, deployed on Vercel
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth with Google/GitHub providers
- **Images:** Cloudinary with custom proxy implementation
- **Redis:** Recipe draft storage.
- **Rate Limiting:** Upstash Redis for API protection

### Microservices
- **[Jorbites Notifier](https://github.com/jorbush/jorbites-notifier)** (Go): Lightweight notification service with FIFO queue
- **[Badge Forge](https://github.com/jorbush/badge_forge)** (Rust): High-performance badge and level calculation system
- **[Pantry Keeper](https://github.com/jorbush/pantry_keeper)** (Python): Automated database backup system

> **Why Microservices?** This architecture overcomes Vercel's 10-second API function limitation, enabling better scalability and performance for compute-intensive operations.
